About project-

Banking Marketing Targets :
Aim : To analyze and predict whether the client will subscribe to the term deposit
Technologies used : Jupyter Notebook, Python 3, Power BI.
Libraries used : Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Imblearn, train_test_split.
Performed the necessary Data pre-processing.
Balanced the imbalanced data set using Imblearn.
Performed the exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Power BI.
Performed Hypothesis Testing using Scipy and Statsmodels.
Performed the feature engineering.
Split the data set into Train set and Test set.
Models used : Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, SVM.
After applying the above models, decided to go with Random Forest because of its high test accuracy
Result : Approximate 14% of the clients will subscribe to the term deposit.
